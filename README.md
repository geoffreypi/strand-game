# Protein Folding Game

A puzzle game inspired by Opus Magnum and Codex of Alchemical Engineering, focused on the molecular biology process from DNA to functional proteins.

## Game Flow
DNA → Transcription → RNA → Post-Transcriptional Modifications → RNA → Translation → Protein → Post-Translational Modifications → Protein

## Prototypes
This directory contains iterative prototypes as we develop the core mechanics.

## Development Notes
- Target: Web-based game (HTML/JavaScript/React)
- Visual Style: Inspired by Opus Magnum's geometric elegance
- Core Mechanic: Spatial puzzle design with molecular machines
